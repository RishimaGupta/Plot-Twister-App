I have attached a detailed report of the app workings in the form of a PDF file.<br/>
•	Developed a full-featured writing assistance app to help users overcome writer’s block by generating random plot ideas based on selected genres and optional supernatural elements<br/>
•	Designed and implemented user authentication (Sign Up, Log In, Guest Mode) using SharedPreferences, ensuring secure and persistent storage of user credentials and stories<br/>
•	Built modular activities and fragments including Home, Profile, Write Story, Saved Stories, and Settings for a seamless user experience<br/>
•	Integrated Bottom Navigation, Side Drawer Navigation, and Context/Pop-Up Menus for smooth navigation and story sharing options<br/>
•	Added story writing tools such as font adjustment using SeekBar, word count calculator, timer, date & time picker for writing reminders, and a dark mode toggle<br/>
•	Implemented RecyclerView to display saved stories per user, with options to edit or delete stories via context menu
